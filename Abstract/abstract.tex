In Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Machine Learning (ML) is an alternative for understanding larger and high-dimensional data. Dimensionality Reduction (DR) algorithms such as t-SNE produce two or three dimensional embeddings looking to preserve local and global structure of data. By the other hand, Clustering algorithms such as K-Means seek to achieve a similar goal by producing a cluster membership for each data instance. In general terms, when using these kind of algorithms, non-expert ML users can derive wrong conclusions if an appropriate set of hyper-parameters for fitting the algorithm is not selected. Similarly, groups of attributes and  data instances could represent, for instance, high-levels of noise in the data significantly affecting the embedding and clustering formation. To address this, MLExplore.js, a web-based tool for exploring high-dimensional tabular data that implements the t-SNE and K-Means algorithms running in the browser is presented. Because this tool is targeted to domain-expert users, some concepts and recommendations for designing user-centric ML systems are derived from the Interactive ML and Interpretable ML sub-fields. Like some other ML-based EDA tools, MLExplore.js allows users to explore the hyper-parameter space while interactively seeing how these changes affect the model results. In addition, the ability to evidence model changes when user perform attribute selection and data navigation is also included. This enables domain-expert users to perform cluster-oriented DR task sequences such as verify clusters, name clusters and match cluster and classes. To demonstrate its usage, one case study of exploring a real-world dataset is presented.

%Preserve the global structure, in the context of these algorithms, is established as the ability for making clusters visually identifiable by the user.

%Dimensionality Reduction (DR) algorithms such as t-SNE intend to produce 2D or 3D visual embeddings from high-dimensional data. However, despite embeddings are simple and beautiful data representations, it has been shown that non-expert Machine Learning (ML) users can derive wrong conclusions if they don't select the most appropriate hyper-parameters for fitting the algorithm to that specific dataset. In a similar way, groups of attributes and instances the could  represent, for instance, high-levels of noise in the data can significantly affect the resulting embedding. To address this, we present a web-based tool designed for domain-expert users, which don't need to be experts in ML and even have programming skills to use. In the same way than other DR-based Visual Analytics tools, our tool allows users to explore the hyper-parameter space while interactively seeing changes in the embedding. In addition, we provide users with the ability to understand what changes in the original high-dimensional space, in terms of attributes and instances, drive the fitting of the embedding space. Going further, this tool enable domain-expert users to perform cluster-oriented DR task sequences for their own labeled or unlabeled data, providing a implementation of the K-Means clustering algorithm, without having to write a line of code. This paper presents the design process of the tool, which takes some recommendations from the state of the art for building interactive ML interfaces, and presents two case studies that demonstrate its functionalities. We also contribute the open-source tool that is accessible for domain-experts to derive insights from their data.
